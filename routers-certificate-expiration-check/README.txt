 ====================
Script structure:

 * Connect to each device by ssh, issue "sh crypto pki certificates" | search()
 * Get output and split it into parts for each certificate (Condition = line doesn't start from ' ' and contains 'Certificate') | split_text()
 * For each certificate get fields: "end date" and "Associated Trustpoints" | extract_cert_info()
 
Errors:
 CONNECTION_ERROR - ssh error, or command cannot be executed\not supported
 CERT_NOT_FOUND - no certificates to parse
 SCRIPT_ERROR - certificate parsing error
 
 ====================
Script output example - results.csv:
<Hostname>,<IP>,<Script status>,<Cert end date>,<Trustpoint name>
